# Project overview and purpose.
The project is a fundamentals of data science & computational intelligence assignment to Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing using R to understand the dataset provided, on kenyan students data with a focus on universities,  to reflect academic, socioeconomic, and behavioral attributes, such as study hours, family income, residency (urban/rural), and mobile money usage.

# Instructions. 
The project runs on R Studio, make sure that you install these packages if they are not already installed:
required_packages <- c("tidyverse", "data.table", "ggplot2", "readr")

# Summary
Study Hours by Residency: Urban students tend to have more study hours compared to their rural counterparts, possibly due to better access to resources.  
Math Scores by Performance & Gender: Boxplots indicate that male students slightly outperform female students in mathematics across all performance categories.  
Internet Access Association: Chi-squared tests suggest a significant relationship between internet access and academic performance, highlighting the importance of digital resources in education.  
Extracurriculars vs Performance: Contingency tables reveal that students engaged in sports and arts tend to perform better academically, suggesting the benefits of a balanced educational experience.  
Study Hours-Total Score Relationship: Scatter plots show a positive correlation between study hours and total scores, with urban students benefiting more from increased study time.

# Structure of the repository. 
You will find all the codes used for this project under "codes for each question" folder. There is also a another zipped folder on the same where you can get the raw data. 
The "visuals" folder contains all plots for better visualization of the data.
